**Reg No**: 212222040186


## **Objectives**
1. **Log into AWS**: Access the AWS Management Console to create and manage resources.
2. **Launch EC2 Instance**: Configure the required instance parameters, including OS, storage, instance type, and network settings.
3. **Create Key Pair**: Generate a secure SSH key pair for EC2 access.
4. **Configure Network**: Adjust the instanceâ€™s VPC, subnets, and security groups as needed.
5. **Connect to Instance**: Use SSH to establish a connection to the EC2 instance.
6. **Automate EC2 Instance Creation**: Set up an Ansible playbook to automate the instance setup.
7. **Monitor Instance State**: Track instance states (running, stopped, terminated) and utilize AWS CloudWatch for performance monitoring.
